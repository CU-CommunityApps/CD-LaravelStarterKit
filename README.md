# CD-LaravelStarterKit

A Cornell University CIT Custom Development starter kit package for Laravel.

## Goals
- Reduce time to build Laravel apps
- Increase consistency in configuration, third-party packages, and architecture
- Increase code visibility, code quality, and team collaboration
- Continuously improve code and practices
- Lower barriers for support and reduce support time

## Getting Started
Anyone on the Custom Development team should be welcome and able to contribute.
- See the #cd-laravel-starter-kit CIT Slack channel for current activity.
- See the [GitHub project discussions](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/CD-LaravelStarterKit/discussions) for general notes and discussion.
- See the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/CD-LaravelStarterKit/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/CD-LaravelStarterKit/pulls) for work that needs to be done or reviewed.

## Local Development Setup
The Laravel Starter Kit is a package, so the development and use of it is not the same as a Laravel project. It may be of use to read [Laravel Package Development](https://laravelpackage.com/) and the [Laravel Package Development documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/packages).

TODO: Add details on local development environment and process after general principles are agreed upon. 

## Development Standards
In order to support working collaboratively, PHP and Laravel standards should be applied, ideally in ways that are quick and automatic.

TODO: Document standards in use and mechanisms for applying them with common tools.

## Development Workflow
All work should be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer via a GitHub pull request before being merged to the main branch.

TODO: Provide guidelines for reviews and clarify what must be done before a PR can be merged.
