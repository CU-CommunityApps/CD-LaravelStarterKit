# Laravel Starter Kit

A Cornell University CIT Custom Development starter kit and library for Laravel.

## Goals
- Reduce time to build Laravel apps
- Increase consistency in configuration, third-party packages, and architecture
- Increase code visibility, code quality, and team collaboration
- Continuously improve code and practices
- Lower barriers for support and reduce support time

## Usage

The Starter Kit can be used as a starter kit for a new site or as a library for an existing site.

### Starter Kit

Used as a starter kit, this package deploys the cwd_framework_lite infrastructure and standard configuration files. The
steps below get from a fresh Laravel install to a working site.

1. Follow [standard Laravel project creation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#your-first-laravel-project), namely
   ```shell
   composer create-project --no-dev laravel/laravel your-app-name
   ```
   This is done with the `--no-dev` option, because we will be committing the vendor dir and don't need that extra baggage.
   >**NOTE**: If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can immediately add this to GitHub as a repo with the following commands (be sure to replace the "your-app-name" references with your project info):
   > ```shell
   > cd your-app-name
   > git init
   > git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
   > git branch -m main
   > gh repo create --private CU-CommunityApps/CD-your-app-name
   > git push --set-upstream origin main
   > ```
   
2. Composer require the LaravelStarterKit
   ```shell
   composer require --update-no-dev cornell-custom-dev/laravel-starter-kit
   ```
   Similar to the `create-project` option, the `--update-no-dev` keeps us from adding baggage to the vendor dir.

3. Install the Starter Kit
   ```shell
   php artisan starterkit:install
   ```
   This will publish `README.md`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, and `.lando.yml` files to the base directory, configured on the project settings and update the `composer.json` file to match. It will also publish HTML/CSS/JS assets from [cwd_framework_lite](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/cwd_framework_lite) and a set of [view components](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#layouts-using-components) that can be used to begin a layout (see `views/cd-index.blade.php` for example usage).
   > **NOTE**: The install step updates `.gitignore` so that the vendor directory is no longer excluded. The next commit will be large because it includes everything in the vendor directory.
   >```shell
   > git add . && git commit -m "Starter Kit install"
   > git push
   >```

4. Testing the site<br>
   You can confirm the site is working with Lando, since the Starter Kit install process adds a `.lando.yml` file.
   ```shell
   lando start
   ```
   Then visit https://your-app-name.lndo.site and you should see the default Laravel page. To see the Laravel Starter Kit example page, edit `/resources/views/welcome.blade.php` to be:
    ```blade
    @include('cd-index')
    ```

### Existing Site

For an existing Laravel site, this package can be composer-required to provide the library of classes. In this case, you
will not need to run the full Starter Kit install.

```php
composer require --update-no-dev cornell-custom-dev/laravel-starter-kit

```

## Libraries

The libraries included in the Starter Kit are documented in their respective README files:

- [Contact/PhoneNumber](src/Contact/README.md): A library for parsing and formatting a phone number.


## Deploying a site
Once a Media3 site has been created, you have confirmed you can reach the default site via a web browser, and you have access to the site login by command line, the code can be deployed.

You will likely need to map the `php` command to the correct version by editing `~/.bashrc` to include this alias (for this to take effect, run `source ~/.bashrc` or just log in again):
```shell
# User specific aliases and functions
alias php="/usr/local/bin/ea-php81"
```

Since `www/your-site/public` will already exist, you need to do a little moving things around to git clone your site repo from GitHub:
```shell
cd www/your-site
mv public public.default
git clone --bare https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/CD-your-app-name.git .git
git init && git checkout main
```

At this point you can configure the `www/your-site/.env` file:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
nano .env
```

Be sure to set your `APP_*` values to appropriate values, based on whether it is production:
```dotenv
APP_NAME="Your Site"
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-site.edu
```
```dotenv
APP_NAME="Your Site - TEST"
APP_ENV=testing
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=https://test.your-site.edu
```
If you visit your site now, you should see the Laravel site working.
